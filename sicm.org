Welcome to my tour of Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics. I'm
working on this book to develop my sense of the best way to do research in
public; this book is heavy on math, programming and visualization, and should
stress the normal tools.

I'm attempting to take notes in on org-mode file, and generate all my code from
there.

I don't think I have the heart, or the time, to really do high-class notes of
every single section; but I am going to do each of the exercises, and explore
some of the code-based concepts in each section.

* Preface
:PROPERTIES:
:UNNUMBERED: t

The preface is already intriguing. A tour through the new notation, plus some
discussion of why a programming language is the best route in to this stuff.
Both of these are extremely powerful ideas, and why I was pulled to this book in
the first place.

The functional notation is:

\begin{equation}
  D (\partial_2 L \circ \Gamma[q]) - (\partial_1 L \circ \Gamma[q]) = 0
\end{equation}

Compare that to the traditional notation:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{d}{dt} \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q^i} -\frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i}= 0
\end{equation}

They have a nice riff on how this is totally ambiguous. $\Gamma$ is not a great
way to go.

** Exercise 1.1: Degrees of Freedom and 1.2: Generalized Coordinates

This exercise is designed to get you thinking about the idea of /configuration
space/. One goal of classical mechanics is to predict the future of a system,
based on a description of the current state of the system. So how to describe
the system?

One way would be to track, for every instant of time, a 3-dimensional position
for every particle in a system, along with velocities in each direction, for a
total of 6 numbers - or /dimensions/ - per particle.

That's fine for particles moving in straight lines through space, not affecting
each other. But remember, this is all an accounting trick that we're using to
represent reality, not reality itself. If there is some more convenient way to
track the state of the system, we're free to use that as well, provided we can
recover the original positions and velocities after evolving the system.

Maybe two particles are attached to each other, so their positions in space are
the same, or offset by a tiny amount. Then it's enough to track:

- the position of one of the particles (3 numbers)
- the angle and distance of the offset (2 numbers)

What seemed like a system that required 6 numbers actually required 5.

Theo Jansen's incredible [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LewVEF2B_pM][Strandbeesten]] are built out of copies of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jansen%27s_linkage][Jansen's
Linkage]]. Each of these legs has 11 pipes that flex and bend, but only *one*
degree of freedom.

The first exercise gives us some practice thinking about the redundancy in
different physical systems.

#+begin_quote
For each of the mechanical systems described below, give the number of degrees
of freedom of the configuration space. ([[https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/chapter001.html#Exe_1-1][SICM, ex1]])
#+end_quote

[[https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/chapter001.html#Exe_1-2][Exercise 1.2]] asks about the "generalized coordinates" of each system. What are
the actual numbers that we want to track for each system, if not the $3N$
positions of each of $N$ particles?

#+begin_quote
For each of the systems in exercise 1.1, specify a system of generalized
coordinates that can be used to describe the behavior of the system.
#+end_quote

1. Three juggling pins.

   The system has **18 degrees of freedom**. Each pin requires 3 coordinates to
   specify its center of mass, and 3 angles for each pin. If you assume that
   each pin is symmetric about its central axis, then it doesn't matter how far
   around the pin has rotated and you can make do with **15 degrees of
   freedom**. 3 positions and 2 angles for each.

2. A spherical pendulum consisting of a point mass (the pendulum bob) hanging
   from a rigid massless rod attached to a fixed support point. The pendulum bob
   may move in any direction subject to the constraint imposed by the rigid rod.
   The point mass is subject to the uniform force of gravity.

   This system has only **2 degrees of freedom**. One for the latitude of the
   pendulum, and one for the longitude.

3. A spherical double pendulum, consisting of one point mass hanging from a
   rigid massless rod attached to a second point mass hanging from a second
   massless rod attached to a fixed support point. The point masses are subject
   to the uniform force of gravity.

   **4 degrees of freedom**; two angles from previous, plus two more angles for
   the second pendulum off of the first.

4. A point mass sliding without friction on a rigid curved wire.

   **1 degree of freedom**; the distance along the wire.

5. A top consisting of a rigid axisymmetric body with one point on the symmetry
   axis of the body attached to a fixed support, subject to a uniform
   gravitational force.

   This system seems to have **2 degrees of freedom**, for the angles off of
   vertical. It's like a spherical pendulum, but upside down. What I find
   strange about this answer is that the top does have a rotation speed, which
   is a measure of how far the top has rotated in time. How can we track this
   velocity if we don't track the top's spin angle? This may be wrong.

6. The same as *5*, but not axisymmetric.

   A non-symmetric top has **3 degrees of freedom**. 2 from before, and an
   additional angle to measure how far around the top has rotated.

This problem has us exploring some consequences for optics of the principle of
least time. [[https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/chapter001.html#Exe_1-3][Exercise 1.3]] states:

#+begin_quote
Fermat observed that the laws of reflection and refraction could be accounted
for by the following facts: Light travels in a straight line in any particular
medium with a velocity that depends upon the medium. The path taken by a ray
from a source to a destination through any sequence of media is a path of least
total time, compared to neighboring paths. Show that these facts imply the laws
of reflection and refraction.
#+end_quote

*** Law of Reflection

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)#Laws_of_reflection][law of reflection]] is described in the footnote:

#+begin_quote
For reflection the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
#+end_quote

Here's the setup. The horizontal line is a mirror. The law states that $\theta_1
= \theta_2$.

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2020-06-10 10:31:24

[[file:images/Lagrangian_Mechanics/2020-06-10_10-31-24_screenshot.png]]

We have to show that if we consider all possible paths from a given starting
point to a given endpoint, the path of minimum time will give us the law of
reflection.

The /actual/ path of minimum time is the straight line that avoids the mirror,
of course. If we force the light to bounce off of the mirror, then we have to
figure out where it will hit, where $x_p$ is, to minimize the time between the
start and end points.

There are two ways to solve this problem. We can use geometry and visual
intuition, or we can use calculus.

**** Geometry

First, recall this fact from the problem text:

#+begin_quote
Light travels in a straight line in any particular medium with a velocity that
depends upon the medium.
#+end_quote

There's no medium change, so if there were no mirror in its path, the light beam
would continue in a straight line. Instead of figuring out what the beam will do
when it hits the mirror, reflect the endpoint across the mirror and draw a
straight line between the start and "end" points:

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2020-06-10 10:36:53
#+attr_org: :width 400px
#+attr_html: :width 80% :align center
#+attr_latex: :width 8cm
[[file:images/Lagrangian_Mechanics/2020-06-10_10-36-53_screenshot.png]]

The angle that the beam makes with the plane of the mirror is the same on both
sides of the mirror.

Now reflect the the "end" point and the segment of the beam that's crossed the
mirror back up. By symmetry, $\theta_1 = \theta_2$, and we've proved the law of
reflection.

**** Calculus

We can also solve this with calculus. Because the beam doesn't change media, its
speed $v$ stays constant, so minimizing the total distance $d$ is equivalent to
minimizing the time $t = {d \over v}$.

Set $x_1 = 0$ for convenience, and write the total distance the light travels as
a function of $x_p$:

\begin{equation}
d(x_p) = \sqrt{y_1^2 + x_p^2} + \sqrt{(x_2 - x_p)^2 + y_2^2}
\end{equation}

For practice, we can also define this function in Scheme.

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((total-distance x1 y1 x2 y2) xp)
  (+ (sqrt (+ (square (+ x1 xp))
              (square y1)))
     (sqrt (+ (square (- x2 (+ x1 xp)))
              (square y2)))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Here's the function again, generated from code, with general $t_1$:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 ((total-distance 'x_1 'y_1 'x_2 'y_2) 'x_p))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[084acf42d4fe771c97db9cf39e92c75383662d30]:

\end{equation}

To find the $x_p$ that minimizes the total distance,

- take the derivative with respect to $x_p$,
- set it equal to 0 and
- solve for $x_p$.

The derivative will look cleaner in code if we keep the components of the sum
separate and prevent Scheme from "simplifying". Redefine the function to return
a tuple:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((total-distance* x1 y1 x2 y2) xp)
  (up (sqrt (+ (square (+ x1 xp))
               (square y1)))
      (sqrt (+ (square (- x2 (+ x1 xp)))
               (square y2)))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| total-distance* |#

Here are the sum components:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation

#+end_src

\end{equation}

Taking a derivative is easy with =scmutils=. Just wrap the function in =D=:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((distance-fn (total-distance* 0 'y_1 'x_2 'y_2))
       (derivative (D distance-fn)))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS[5bbf36ca4a362ee2f2d2423071a6f818c8c93cab]:

\end{equation}

The first component is the base of base $x_p$ of the left triangle over the
total length. This ratio is equal to $\cos \theta_1$:

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2020-06-10 10:36:53
#+attr_org: :width 400px

#+attr_latex: :width 8cm
[[file:images/Lagrangian_Mechanics/2020-06-10_10-36-53_screenshot.png]]

The bottom component is $-\cos \theta_2$, or ${- (x_2 - x_p)}$ over the length
of the right segment. Add these terms together, set them equal to 0 and
rearrange:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reflect-laws}
\cos \theta_1 = \cos \theta_2 \implies \theta_1 = \theta_2
\end{equation}

This description in terms of the two incident angles isn't so obvious from the
Scheme code. Still, you can use Scheme to check this result.

If the two angles are equal, then the left and right triangles are similar, and
the ratio of each base to height is equal:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reflect-ratio}
{x_p \over y_1} = {{x_2 - x_p} \over y_2}
\end{equation}

Solve for $x_p$ and rearrange:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:reflect-ratio2}
x_p = {{y_1 x_2} \over {y_1 + y_2}}
\end{equation}

Plug this in to the derivative of the original =total-distance= function, and we
find that the derivative equals 0, as expected:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((distance-fn (total-distance 0 'y_1 'x_2 'y_2))
       (derivative (D distance-fn)))

#+end_src

#+RESULTS[535d1b50ac55ba86347a21920c8bbf87153148eb]:

0
\end{equation}

If a beam of light travels in a way that minimizes total distance (and therefore
time in a constant medium), then it will reflect off of a mirror with the same
angle at which it arrived. The law of reflection holds.

*** Law of Refraction

The law of refraction is also called [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law][Snell's law]]. Here's the description from
the footnote:

#+begin_quote
Refraction is described by Snell's law: when light passes from one medium to
another, the ratio of the sines of the angles made to the normal to the
interface is the inverse of the ratio of the refractive indices of the media.
The refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in the vacuum to the
speed of light in the medium.
#+end_quote

First we'll tackle this with calculus.

**** Calculus

The setup here is slightly different. We have a light beam traveling from one
medium to another and changing speeds at a boundary located $a$ to the right of
the starting point. The goal is to figure out the point where the light will hit
the boundary, if we assume that the light will take the path of least time.

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2020-06-10 12:03:11
#+attr_org: :width 400px
#+attr_html: :width 80% :align center
#+attr_latex: :width 8cm
[[file:images/Lagrangian_Mechanics/2020-06-10_12-03-11_screenshot.png]]

The refractive index $n_i = {c \over v_i}$, the speed of light $c$ in a vacuum
over the speed in the material. Rearranging, $v_i = {c \over n_i}$.

Time is distance over speed, so the total time that the beam spends between the
start and end points as a function of $y_p$, the point of contact with the
boundary, is:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    t(y_p) & = {c \sqrt{a^2 + y_p^2}\over v_1} + {c \sqrt{(x_2 - x_p)^2 + y_2^2} \over v_2} \cr
    & = {n_1 \over c} \sqrt{a^2 + y_p^2} + {n_2 \over c} \sqrt{(x_2 - x_p)^2 + y_2^2}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Take the derivative:

\begin{equation}
  Dt(y_p) = {1 \over c} \left({n_1 y_p \over \sqrt{a^2 + y_p^2}} - {n_2 (x_2 - x_p) \over \sqrt{(x_2 - x_p)^2 + y_2^2}}\right)
\end{equation}

Set the derivative equal to 0 and split terms:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:almost-snell}
  {n_1 y_p \over \sqrt{a^2 + y_p^2}} = {n_2 (x_2 - x_p) \over \sqrt{(x_2 - x_p)^2 + y_2^2}}
\end{equation}

Similar to the law of reflection's result, each term (up to its $n_i$ multiple)
is equal to the height of the left or right triangle over the length of the
beam's path on the left or right of the boundary.

Equation \eqref{eq:almost-snell} simplifies to:

\begin{equation}
  n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2
\end{equation}

Rearranging yields Snell's law:

\begin{equation}
{n_1 \over n_2} = {\sin \theta_2 \over \sin \theta_1}
\end{equation}

**** Geometry

I won't recreate this here, but the [[https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_26.html][Feynman Lectures on Physics]], in [[https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_26.html][Lecture 26]],
has a fantastic discussion about, and derivation of, the law of refraction using
no calculus, just geometry. I highly recommend you check out that lecture.
Feynman lays out a number of examples of how the principle of least time is not
just a restatement of the optical rules we already knew.

You can use the idea to guess what shape of mirror you'd want to build to focus
many light rays on a single point (a parabola), or how you might force all light
rays coming out of a single point to meet up again at another point (build a
converging lens).

This whole area of optics and least time has obsessed scientists for hundreds of
years. Spend a few minutes [[https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_26.html][poking around]] and see what you find.

** Section 1.4: Computing Actions

I don't plan on doing this for every section in the book, but section 1.4 is the
first place where we're introduced to Scheme, so I followed along and made a few
notes.

This is the first demo of how any of this stuff works, starting on page 15.
Here's our first Lagrangian, super simple.

#+name: L-free-particle
#+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-free-particle mass) local)
  (let ((v (velocity local)))
    (* 1/2 mass (dot-product v v))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: L-free-particle
: #| L-free-particle |#

=L-free-particle= is a function that takes some =mass= and returns a /new/
function. The new function takes an instance of a "local tuple" and returns the
value of the "Lagrangian". This is the function that you query at every point
along some evolving path in configuration space. For realizable physical paths,
the integral of this function should by minimized, or stationary.

Why? That's what we're trying to develop here.

Suppose we let $q$ denote a coordinate path function that maps time to position
components:

#+begin_src scheme
(define q
  (up (literal-function 'x)
      (literal-function 'y)
      (literal-function 'z)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| q |#

$\Gamma$ is a function that takes a coordinate path and returns a function of
time that gives the local tuple.

The value $\Gamma$ returns is called the "local tuple":

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 ((Gamma q) 't))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[1f4aaac455bf48bd20965b4268009969bd7fd58e]:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \displaystyle{ t} \cr \cr \displaystyle{ \begin{pmatrix} \displaystyle{ x\left( t \right)} \cr \cr \displaystyle{ y\left( t \right)} \cr \cr \displaystyle{ z\left( t \right)}\end{pmatrix}} \cr \cr \displaystyle{ \begin{pmatrix} \displaystyle{ Dx\left( t \right)} \cr \cr \displaystyle{ Dy\left( t \right)} \cr \cr \displaystyle{ Dz\left( t \right)}\end{pmatrix}}\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

This is just $(t, q(t), (Dq)(t), ....)$ Where $D$ is the derivative. (Preview:
can a component of the coordinate path depend on the others? YES, and that would
impose constraints beyond the degrees of freedom you'd guess by just counting
the coordinates.)

Composing the Langrangian with $\Gamma[q]$ gives you a function that computes the
Lagrangian at some instant:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 ((compose (L-free-particle 'm) (Gamma q)) 't))
#+end_src

\end{equation}

This particular formula is written in terms of $x, y, z$ coordinates, but that
only came from the definition of $q$. As we'll see later, you could write a
coordinate transformation from some other totally different style of coordinates
(called "generalized coordinates") and the Lagrangian would look different, but
return the same value.

This function calculates the action $S[q](t_1, t_2)$:

#+begin_src scheme

This happens to be the minimal action, since the path we provided was a uniform
path and the Lagrangian was for a free particle. If we'd provided a different
path, we would still get an action. Just not a stationary action. Infinitesimal
wiggles would change the action.

** Exercise 1.4: Lagrangian actions

This exercise has us calculating the actual value of the action along some
realizable path taken by a free particle.

#+begin_quote
For a free particle an appropriate Lagrangian is
#+end_quote

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:14lagrangian}
L(t, x, v) = {1 \over 2}mv^2
\end{equation}

#+begin_quote
Suppose that x is the constant-velocity straight-line path of a free particle,
such that $x_a = x(t_a)$ and $x_b = x(t_b)$. Show that the action on the
solution path is
#+end_quote

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:14result}
{m \over 2}{{(x_b - x_a)^2} \over {t_b - t_a}}
\end{equation}

I'm not sure I see the point of this exercise, for developing intuition about
Langrangian mechanics. I think it may be here to make sure we understand that
we're not minimizing the /function/ $L$. We're minimizing (finding the
stationary point of) the integral of $L$ between $t_a$ and $t_b$.

The velocity is constant between the two points, so it must be equal to the
difference in position over the difference in time:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:constant-v}
v = {{x(t_b) - x(t_a)} \over {t_b - t_a}} = {{x_b - x_a} \over {t_b - t_a}}
\end{equation}

The action is equal to the integral of $L$ evaluated between the two time
points:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \begin{aligned}
    S[q](t_a, t_b) & = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} L(t, x, v) dx \cr
    & = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} {1 \over 2}mv(t)^2 dx \cr
    & = {m \over 2}{v(t)^2 t} \Bigr|_{t_a}^{t_b} \cr
    & = {m \over 2}{v(t_b)^2 t_b - v(t_a)^2 t_a}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The velocity is constant, so substitute in equation \eqref{eq:constant-v} and
simplify:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:4}
  \begin{aligned}
    S[q](t_a, t_b) & = {m \over 2}{({{x_b - x_a} \over {t_b - t_a}})^2 (t_b - t_a)} \cr
    & = {m \over 2}{(x_b - x_a)^2 \over {t_b - t_a}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Boom, solution achieved.

adjustable "variation", or wiggle. We should see that, if we consider a
"realizable path", then any wiggle we add will increase the calculated action.

The only restriction on a variation is that it can't affect the endpoints of the
realizable path. the times and positions of the start and end of the path are
pinned.

=make-eta= takes some path $\nu$ and returns a function that wiggles in some
similar way to $\nu$, but equals 0 at $t_1$ and $t_2$:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((make-eta nu t1 t2) t)
  (* (- t t1) (- t t2) (nu t)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| make-eta |#

Next, define a function that calculates the Lagrangian for a free particle, like
before, but adds in the path variation $\eta$ multiplied by some small scaling factor
$\epsilon$:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((varied-free-particle-action mass q nu t1 t2) epsilon)
  (let ((eta (make-eta nu t1 t2)))
    (Lagrangian-action (L-free-particle mass)
                       (+ q (* epsilon eta))
                       t1
                       t2)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| varied-free-particle-action |#

Consider some variation like $v(t) = (\sin(t), \cos(t), t^2)$. The action of the
path with this small wiggle (processed through =make-eta= to pin its endpoints)
is larger (top entry) than the action of the non-varied path (bottom entry), as
expected:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes :noweb yes

(let ((action-fn (varied-free-particle-action 3.0 test-path
                                              (up sin cos square)

\end{equation}

What value of $\epsilon$ minimizes the action for the test path?

We can search over values of $\epsilon$ from $-2.0$ to $1.0$ using the built-in
=minimize= function:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let ((action-fn (varied-free-particle-action
                  3.0 test-path
                  (up sin cos square)

\begin{equation}
5.134781488891349e-15
\end{equation}

The result shows that the minimum action occurs at $\epsilon = 0$, up to
numerical precision.

*** Finding trajectories that minimize the action

Is it possible to use this principle to actually /find/ a path, instead of
simply checking it?

First we need a function that builds a path. This version generates a path of
individual points, bracketed by the supplied start and end points $(t_0, q_0)$
and $(t_1, q_1)$. $qs$ is a list of intermediate points.

#+begin_src scheme
(define (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 qs)
  (let ((n (length qs)))
    (let ((ts (linear-interpolants t0 t1 n)))
      (Lagrange-interpolation-function
       (append (list q0) qs (list q1))
       (append (list t0) ts (list t1))))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| make-path |#

The next function sort-of-composes =make-path= and =Lagrangian-action= into a
function that takes $L$ and the endpoints, and returns the total action along
the path.

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((parametric-path-action L t0 q0 t1 q1) qs)
  (let ((path (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 qs)))
    (Lagrangian-action L path t0 t1)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| parametric-path-action |#

Finally, =find-path= takes the previous function's arguments, plus a parameter
$n$. $n$ controls how many intermediate points the optimizer will inject and
modify in its attempt to find an action-minimizing path. The more points you
specify, the longer minimization will take, but the more accurate the final path
will be.

#+begin_src scheme
(define (find-path L t0 q0 t1 q1 n)
  (let ((initial-qs (linear-interpolants q0 q1 n)))
    (let ((minimizing-qs
           (multidimensional-minimize
            (parametric-path-action L t0 q0 t1 q1)
            initial-qs)))
      (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 minimizing-qs))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| find-path |#

Let's test it out with a Lagrangian for a one dimensional harmonic oscillator
with spring constant $k$. Here is the Lagrangian, equal to the kinetic energy
minus the potential from the spring:

#+name: L-harmonic
#+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-harmonic m k) local)
  (let ((q (coordinate local))
        (v (velocity local)))
    (- (* 1/2 m (square v))
       (* 1/2 k (square q)))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| L-harmonic |#

Now we invoke the procedures we've built, and plot the final, path-minimizing
trajectory.

#+begin_src scheme
(define harmonic-path
  (find-path (L-harmonic 1.0 1.0) 0.0 1.0 :pi/2 0.0 3))

(define win2 (frame 0.0 :pi/2 0 1))

(plot-function win2 harmonic-path 0 :pi (/ :pi 100))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| win2 |#
:
: #| harmonic-path |#

The path looks like a harmonic oscillator that starts high and bounces down,
after $\pi \over 2$ seconds, down to 0. This is the first quarter of a sine wave
with period $2 \pi$.

** Exercise 1.6: Minimizing action
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args+: :tangle ch1/ex1-6.scm :comments org
:END:

The authors have lightly demonstrated that plausible-looking paths have
stationary action between fixed endpoints. What happens if we overconstrain the
problem?

The exercise asks:

#+begin_quote
Suppose we try to obtain a path by minimizing an action for an impossible
problem. For example, suppose we have a free particle and we impose endpoint
conditions on the velocities as well as the positions that are inconsistent with
the particle being free. Does the formalism protect itself from such an
unpleasant attack? You may find it illuminating to program it and see what
happens.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src scheme :exports none
(load "ch1/utils.scm")
#+end_src

I spent a good amount of time thinking about this exercise. When I attempted to
read this book in 2015, I found it very confusing.

Let's say you take, as the authors suggest, some path, and impose velocity
constraints on the endpoints in addition to the required position constraints.

Usually, you constrain the coordinates at each endpoint and force a path that
minimizes the action between two times. What does it mean to impose velocity
conditions?

The key is to realize that on the computer, you're forcing a path to be composed
of a bunch of discrete points. If you can force a point into the path that is
NOT controlled by the optimizer, then you can force a velocity at some point in
the path that makes no sense for minimal action.

Let's define a new version of =parametric-path-action= that also takes an offset
for the initial and final points. We'll force the first and last intermediate
point to be equal to the start and end points, plus some offset we can supply to
the function.

Then, we can try to find an action-minimizing path, but force the optimizer to
deal with not just our endpoint conditions, but these two extra points as well.
Forcing two points on each end will force an initial velocity condition. An
offset of 0 would be equivalent to imposing a velocity of 0 at the start.

*** Intuition

I simply proceeded with the implementation, but I'd recommend you take a minute
to consider what you /think/ will happen here. A hint is that the code is
attempting to minimize action, given the constraint of the actual Lagrangian.
What will it do when it's forced to battle with a new exterior constraint, not
captured in the Lagrangian?

*** Implementation

Here's the implementation of the modification described earlier:

#+begin_src scheme

(define (((parametric-path-action* win)
          Lagrangian t0 q0 offset0 t1 q1 offset1)
         intermediate-qs)
  ;; See the two new points?
  (let ((intermediate-qs* (append (list (+ q0 offset0))
                                  intermediate-qs
                                  (list (+ q1 offset1)))))
    (let ((path (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 intermediate-qs*)))
      ;; display path
      (graphics-clear win)
      (plot-function win path t0 t1 (/ (- t1 t0) 100))
      ;; compute action
      (Lagrangian-action Lagrangian path t0 t1))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| parametric-path-action* |#

You might try a similar trick by modifying the first and last entries of
=intermediate-qs= instead of appending a point, but I suspect that the optimizer
would be able to figure out how to undo your offset. (Try this as an exercise.)

Next, a new version of =find-path= that passes the offsets through to the new
=parametric-path-action*=:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((find-path* win) L t0 q0 offset0 t1 q1 offset1 n)
  (let ((initial-qs (linear-interpolants q0 q1 n)))
    (let* ((action (parametric-path-action* win))
           (minimizing-qs
            (multidimensional-minimize
             (action L t0 q0 offset0 t1 q1 offset1)
             initial-qs)))
      (make-path t0 q0 t1 q1 minimizing-qs))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| find-path* |#

And finally, a function that can execute runs of our formalism-killing
experiment.

#+begin_src scheme
(define (one-six offset0 offset1 n)
  (let* ((tmax 10)
         (win (frame -1 (+ tmax 1) -0.2 (+ 1.2 offset0 offset1)))
         (find (find-path* win))
         (L (L-free-particle 3.0))
         (path (find L
                     0. 1. offset0
                     tmax 0. offset1
                     n)))
    (Lagrangian-action L path 0 tmax)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| one-six |#

=one-six= takes two offsets and runs the minimization routine against
=L-free-particle=, moving from position 1 to 0 over 10 seconds. =n= controls the
number of interpolation points that the system will use.

Internally, remember, =parametric-path-action*= will append two extra fixed
offset points to the =n= intermediate points that the optimizer gets to control.

*** Execution

Let's run the code with 0 offsets and 3 interpolation points. Note that this
should /still/ distort the path, since we now have two fixed points at the start
and end. This is effectively imposing a 0 velocity constraint at the beginning
and end.

Here's the code, and its output:

#+begin_src scheme
(one-six 0 0 3)
#+end_src

The path ends up looking almost sinusoidal, and takes a while to converge. This
is the best polynomial that the system can come up with that matches the 7
points (3 interpolated, 2 offsets, 1 start and 1 end).

The actual realizable path should be a straight line between the two points. The
initial velocity of

Here's a small positive velocity imposed at the beginning, and 0 at the end:

beginning:

#+begin_src scheme

[[file:images/Lagrangian_Mechanics/2020-06-10_15-11-27_ex1_6_neg5offset.gif]]


The process __does__ converge, but this is only because we only used 3
intermediate points. If you bump up to 10 points, with this code:

#+begin_src scheme
(one-six -0.5 0 10)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

The optimization freezes.

What is going on here? Why does the minimizer converge?

With velocity constraints imposed, we're no longer minimizing the action with
respect to some Lagrangian. We're minimizing the action given two constraints.
You have the Lagrangian, and then the warring goal of the polynomial
interpolation forcing a certain shape on the path. At some point, the minimizer
breaks; internally it ends up pinned between two tugging constraints.

If you make the impulse too big or force too many intermediate points, then the
war is too hardcore and the process never converges. But it's important to note
here that these are details of the computational process. This detail doesn't
break reality. (It would break your model of reality, as it did here, if you
have constraints or forces that you don't capture in the Lagrangian.)

If you /do/ need to impose velocity conditions, it turns out you can use a
Lagrangian that takes acceleration into account. This is discussed in Exercise
1.10.

** Exercise 1.7: Properties of $\delta$

This exercise asks us to prove various products of the variation operator
$\delta_\eta$. This is a sort of higher-order derivative operator. Apply it to a
higher order function $f$, and you'll get a function back that returns the
/sensitivity/ of $f$ to fluctuations in its input path function. (Confusing?
Check out [[https://tgvaughan.github.io/sicm/chapter001.html#h1-6a][the textbook]].)

*** Variation Product Rule

The product rule for variations states that:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-prod}
\delta_\eta (f g)[q] = \delta_\eta f[q] g[q] + f[q] \delta_\eta g[q]
\end{equation}

Write out the left side explicitly, using the definition of $\delta_\eta$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-prod-proof}
  \delta_\eta (f g)[q] = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {f[q + \epsilon\eta]g[q + \epsilon\eta] - f[q]g[q]} \over \epsilon \right)
\end{equation}

Make the inspired move to add and subtract $f[q] g[q + \epsilon \eta]$ inside
the limit, rearrange and factor out the terms that have appeared in common.
(Stare at this for a moment to make sure the steps are clear.)

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-prod-proof2}
\delta_\eta (f g)[q] = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {g[q + \epsilon\eta](f[q + \epsilon\eta] - f[q])} \over \epsilon \right) + f[q] \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {(g[q + \epsilon \eta] - g[q])} \over \epsilon \right)
\end{equation}

You might recognize that we've now isolated terms that look like $\delta_\eta
f[q]$ and $\delta_\eta g[q]$, as $\epsilon$ approaches 0. Notice that as this
happens, $g[q + \epsilon\eta] \to g[q]$, and the whole expression evaluates to
the product rule we were seeking:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-prod2}
\delta_\eta (f g)[q] = \delta_\eta f[q]\,g[q] + f[q]\,\delta_\eta g[q]
\end{equation}

*** Variation Sum Rule

The sum rule is easier. Our goal is to show that:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-sum}
\delta_\eta (f + g)[q] = \delta_\eta f[q] + \delta_\eta g[q]
\end{equation}

Expand out the definition of the variation operator, regroup terms, allow
$\epsilon \to 0$ and notice that we've recovered our goal.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-sum-proof}
\begin{aligned}
  \delta_\eta (f + g)[q] & = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {(f[q + \epsilon\eta] + g[q + \epsilon\eta]) - (f[q] + g[q])} \over \epsilon \right) \cr
  & = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {f[q + \epsilon\eta] - f[q]} \over \epsilon \right) + \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {g[q + \epsilon\eta] - g[q]} \over \epsilon \right) \cr
  & = \delta_\eta f[q] + \delta_\eta g[q]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Done!

*** Variation Scalar Multiplication

We want to show that $\delta_\eta$ preserves multiplication by a scalar $c$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-scalar}
\delta_\eta (c g)[q] = c \delta_\eta g[q]
\end{equation}

Expand out the definition of the variation operator:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-scalar-proof}
\begin{aligned}
  \delta_\eta (c g)[q] & = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {c f[q + \epsilon\eta] - c f[q]} \over \epsilon \right) \cr
  & = c \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {f[q + \epsilon\eta] - f[q]} \over \epsilon \right) \cr
  & = c \delta_\eta f[q]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Done, since the limit operator preserves scalar multiplication.

*** Chain Rule for Variations

The chain rule for variations states that:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-chain}
\delta_\eta h[q] = (DF \circ g[q])\, \delta_\eta g[q] \textrm{ with } h[q] = F \circ g[q]
\end{equation}

Expand this out using the definition of $\delta_\eta$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-chain-proof}
  \delta_\eta (F \circ g[q]) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {(F \circ g[q + \epsilon\eta]) - (F \circ g[q])} \over \epsilon \right)
\end{equation}

Now multiply the term inside the limit by $1 = {{g[q + \epsilon\eta] - g[q]}
\over {g[q + \epsilon\eta] - g[q]}}$ and factor out the new, more recognizable
product that forms:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-chain-proof2}
\begin{aligned}
  \delta_\eta (F \circ g[q]) & = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {((F \circ g[q + \epsilon\eta]) - (F \circ g[q]))({g[q + \epsilon\eta] - g[q]})} \over {({g[q + \epsilon\eta] - g[q]}) \epsilon} \right) \cr
  & = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {(F \circ g[q + \epsilon\eta]) - (F \circ g[q])} \over {g[q + \epsilon\eta] - g[q]} \right) \delta_\eta g[q]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The remaining term inside the limit has the form of a derivative of some
function $f$ evaluated at a point $a$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-chain-proof3}
Df(a) = \lim_{b \to a} \left( {f(b) - f(a)} \over {b - a} \right)
\end{equation}

Where $b = g[q + \epsilon \eta]$ and $a = g[q]$. As $\epsilon \to 0$,
$F \circ g[q + \epsilon \eta] \to F \circ g[q]$. We know this because we showed
that $\delta_\eta g[q]$ exists and factored it out.

Remember that that this is all function algebra, so composition here is
analogous to function application; so $F$ is indeed the $f$ in equation
\eqref{eq:var-chain-proof3}, and the remaining term collapses to $DF$ evaluated
at $a = g[q]$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-chain-proof4}
  \delta_\eta (F \circ g[q]) = (DF \circ g[q])\, \delta_\eta g[q]
\end{equation}

*** $\delta_\eta$ commutes with $D$

We need to show the derivative can commute with a normal derivative of the
function that $f$ returns after it's passed a path:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-commute}
D \delta_\eta f[q] = \delta_\eta g[q] \textrm{ with } g[q] = D(f[q])
\end{equation}

Expand the left side by the definition of $\delta_\eta$:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-commute-proof}
  D (\delta_\eta f[q]) = D \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {(f[q + \epsilon\eta]) - (f[q])} \over \epsilon \right)
\end{equation}

The derivative $D$ is a linear operator, so we can move it in to the limit and
distribute it over subtraction:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:var-commute-proof2}
\begin{aligned}
  D (\delta_\eta f[q]) & = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {D(f[q + \epsilon\eta]) - D(f[q])} \over \epsilon \right) \cr
  & = \delta_\eta(D(f[q]))
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Our goal is achieved.

*** Part A: Implement $\delta_\eta$

The goal here is to implement $\delta_\eta$ as a procedure. Explicitly:

#+begin_quote
Suppose we have a procedure =f= that implements a path-dependent function: for
path =q= and time =t= it has the value =((f q) t)=. The procedure delta computes
the variation $\delta_\eta f[q](t)$ as the value of the expression =((((delta
eta) f) q) t)=. Complete the definition of =delta=:
#+end_quote

After laboriously proving all of the properties above, the actual implementation
feels so simple.

The key is equation 1.22 in the book:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1-22}
\delta_\eta f[q] = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \left( {g(\epsilon) - g(0)} \over \epsilon \right) = Dg(0)
\end{equation}

Given $g(\epsilon) = f[q + \epsilon \eta]$. Through the magic of automatic
differentiation we can simply write:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (((delta eta) f) q)
  (let ((g (lambda (eps)
             (f (+ q (* eps eta))))))
    ((D g) 0)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| delta |#

It's almost spooky, that $D$ can somehow figure out what to do here.

*** Part B: Check $\delta_\eta$'s properties

Part B's problem description gave us a path-dependent function similar to this
one:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((fn sym) q)
  (let* ((Local (UP Real (UP* Real) (UP* Real)))
         (F (literal-function sym (-> Local Real))))
    (compose F (Gamma q))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| fn |#

I've modified it slightly to take in a symbol, since we'll need to generate
multiple functions for a few of the rules.

$fn$ takes a symbol like $F$ and a path function -- a function from $t$ to any
number of coordinates (see the =UP*=?) -- and returns a generic expression for a
path dependent function $F$ that acts via $F \circ \Gamma[q]$. $F$ might be a
Lagrangian, for example.

The textbook also gives us this function from $t \to (x, y)$ to test out the
properties above. I've added an $\eta$ of the same type signature that we can
use to add variation to the path.

#+begin_src scheme
(define q (literal-function 'q (-> Real (UP Real Real))))
(define eta (literal-function 'eta (-> Real (UP Real Real))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| q |#
:
: #| eta |#

These weren't easy to write down, but they really do constitute proofs. If you
trust the system managing the algebra, then the equalities here are general.
This is an area of computing I haven't worked with much, but I'm left with the
eery feeling that these are more powerful than any tests I might have decided to
write, if I weren't guided by this exercise.

**** Variation Product Rule

Equation \eqref{eq:var-prod} states the product rule for variations. Here it is
in code. I've implemented the right and left sides and subtracted them. As
expected, the result is 0:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((f (fn 'f))
       (g (fn 'g))
       (de (delta eta)))
  (let ((left ((de (* f g)) q))
        (right (+ (* (g q) ((de f) q))
                  (* (f q) ((de g) q)))))
    (->tex-equation
     ((- left right) 't))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[a1c8ed29c32a4b30412af5c2bbd632edd7a63a42]:
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

**** Variation Sum Rule

The sum rule is similar. Here's the Scheme implementation of equation
\eqref{eq:var-sum}:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((f (fn 'f))
       (g (fn 'g))
       (de (delta eta)))
  (let ((left ((de (+ f g)) q))
        (right (+ ((de f) q)
                  ((de g) q))))
    (->tex-equation
     ((- left right) 't))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[2109df50bd5a522b7140b5656b20b90ee52e5e63]:
\begin{equation}
0
\end{equation}

**** Variation Scalar Multiplication

Here's equation \eqref{eq:var-scalar} in code. The sides are equal, so their
difference is 0:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((g (fn 'g))
       (de (delta eta)))
  (let ((left ((de (* 'c g)) q))
        (right (* 'c ((de g) q))))
    (->tex-equation
     ((- left right) 't))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[9feb0bdde1e870101cd1e1e41df0774ae2be5d6b]:
\begin{equation}
0
\end{equation}

**** Chain Rule for Variations

To compute the chain rule we'll need a version of =fn= that takes the derivative
of the inner function:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((Dfn sym) q)
  (let* ((Local (UP Real (UP* Real) (UP* Real)))
         (F (literal-function sym (-> Local Real))))
    (compose (D F) (Gamma q))))
#+end_src

For the Scheme implementation, remember that both =fn= and =Dfn= have $\Gamma$
baked in. The $g$ in equation \eqref{eq:var-chain} is hardcoded to $\Gamma$ in
the function below.

Here's a check that the two sides of equation \eqref{eq:var-chain} are equal:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((h (fn 'F))
       (dh (Dfn 'F))
       (de (delta eta)))
  (let ((left (de h))
        (right (* dh (de Gamma))))
    (->tex-equation
     (((- left right) q) 't))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[539d27f8dd21a8838b24cf4b3c24a157597e0a42]:
\begin{equation}
0
\end{equation}

**** $\delta_\eta$ commutes with $D$

Our final test. Here's equation \eqref{eq:var-commute} in code, showing that the
derivative commutes with the variation operator:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((f (fn 'f))
       (g (compose D f))
       (de (delta eta)))
  (let ((left (D ((de f) q)))

    (->tex-equation
     ((- left right) 't))))

** Exercise 1.9: Lagrange's equations

This exercise asks us to derive Lagrange's equations in steps for three
different systems. Is this conscionable, given that we have the computer
available to do the algebra for us? I think that this exercise is good practice
for understanding the syntax, and maybe for refreshing your memory of how to
symbolically manipulate derivatives.

But I'm feeling more and more that we're in the middle of a thicket of exercises
that are smugly attempting to show us how bad life is with pencil and paper, and
how nice a computer algebra system can be. These paper-and-pencil problems are
going to get harder and harder, while they stay trivial in Scheme.

Decide for yourself. Exercise 1.12 solves implements each Lagrangian in Scheme
and demonstrates the steps required to get to Lagrange's equations; I do buy
that it would be difficult to do this without a good handle on the syntax.

Give it a try, then go examine exercise 1.12.

** Exercise 1.10: Higher-derivative Lagrangians
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args+: :tangle ch1/ex1-10.scm :comments org
:END:

The only reason that the Lagrangians we've been considering don't take any local
tuple components beyond velocity is that the physics of our universe seems
concerned with updating velocities and nothing beyond. Newton's second law gives
us an update rule for the velocities in a system, and we picked the Lagrangian
so that Lagrange's equations would match Newton's second law.

But the formula for action works just as well if the Lagrangian takes many, or
infinite, derivatives of the original coordinates. This exercise asks us to:

#+begin_quote
Derive Lagrange's equations for Lagrangians that depend on accelerations. In
particular, show that the Lagrange equations for Lagrangians of the form $L(t,
q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q})$ with $\ddot{q}$ terms are

\begin{equation}
  D^2(\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q]) - D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) + (\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q]) = 0
\end{equation}
#+end_quote

In other words, find the constraint that has to be true of the Lagrangian for
the action to be stationary along the supplied path.

This derivation follows the derivation of the Lagrange equations from the book,
starting on page 28. Begin with the equation for action with an acceleration
argument to $L$:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    S[q](t_a, t_b) & = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} L(t, x(t), v(t), a(t)) dx \cr
    & = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} (L \circ \Gamma[q])
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

apply the variation operator, $\delta_\eta$:

\begin{equation}
  \delta_\eta S[q](t_a, t_b) = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} \delta_\eta (L \circ \Gamma[q])
\end{equation}

Expand the right side out using the chain rule for variations, equation
\eqref{eq:var-chain}:

\begin{equation}
  \int_{t_a}^{t_b} \delta_\eta (L \circ \Gamma[q])  =\int_{t_a}^{t_b} ((DL) \circ \Gamma[q]) \delta_\eta\Gamma[q]
\end{equation}

From equations 1.20 and 1.21 in the book, we know that

\begin{equation}
\delta_\eta\Gamma[q] = (0, \eta, D\eta, D^2\eta, \ldots)
\end{equation}

Expand the chain rule up to the $n$th derivative of the coordinate:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_{t_a}^{t_b} & ((DL) \circ \Gamma[q]) \delta_\eta\Gamma[q] = \cr
    & \int_{t_a}^{t_b} 0 + (\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q])\eta + (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])D\eta + \ldots + (\partial_{n + 1}L \circ \Gamma[q])D^n\eta
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Our goal now is to find some quantity inside the integral that doesn't depend on
$\eta$. Setting that quantity to $0$ will give us the Lagrange equations. Focus
on the $\partial_2 L$ term:

\begin{equation}
  \int_{t_a}^{t_b} (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])D\eta
\end{equation}

Integrate by parts:

\begin{equation}
  \int_{t_a}^{t_b} (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])D\eta = (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])\eta \Bigr|_{t_a}^{t_b} - \int_{t_a}^{t_b} D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])\eta
\end{equation}

The first of the two terms disappears, since, by definition, $\eta(t_a) =
\eta(t_b) = 0$, leaving us with:

\begin{equation}
  \int_{t_a}^{t_b} (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])D\eta = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])\eta
\end{equation}

And reducing the full equation to:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_{t_a}^{t_b} & ((DL) \circ \Gamma[q]) \delta_\eta\Gamma[q] = \cr
    & \int_{t_a}^{t_b} ((\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q]) - D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]))\eta + (\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q])D^2\eta \cr
    & + \ldots + (\partial_{n + 1}L \circ \Gamma[q])D^n\eta
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The original Lagrange equations are peeking at us, multiplied by $\eta$.

Can we get another term into that form and move it in with the original Lagrange
equation terms? Take the next term and integrate by parts twice:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_{t_a}^{t_b} (\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q])D^2\eta & = (\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q])D\eta \Bigr|_{t_a}^{t_b} - \int_{t_a}^{t_b} D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])D\eta \cr
    & = (\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q])D\eta \Bigr|_{t_a}^{t_b} - D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])\eta \Bigr|_{t_a}^{t_b} + \int_{t_a}^{t_b} D^2(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])\eta
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The second of the two definite evaluations disappears, since, as before,
$\eta(t_a) = \eta(t_b) = 0$. The first of the definite evaluations suggests that
we need a new constraint to achieve higher-derivative Lagrange equations.

If we require $D\eta(t_a) = D\eta(t_b) = 0$, then the first definite evaluation
disappears as well. So, for a Lagrangian that considers acceleration, we have to
impose the constraint that the path's endpoint velocities can't vary. The
path-wiggle's endpoints can't be in motion.

The term collapses to:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_{t_a}^{t_b} (\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q])D^2\eta & = (\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q])D\eta \Bigr|_{t_a}^{t_b} - D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])\eta \Bigr|_{t_a}^{t_b} + \int_{t_a}^{t_b} D^2(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])\eta \cr
    & = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} D^2(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])\eta
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Fold this back in to the full equation:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \int_{t_a}^{t_b} & ((DL) \circ \Gamma[q]) \delta_\eta\Gamma[q] = \cr
    & \int_{t_a}^{t_b} ((\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q]) - D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) + D^2(\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q]))\eta \cr
    & + \ldots + (\partial_{n + 1}L \circ \Gamma[q])D^n\eta
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

For a Lagrangian of the form $L(t, q, \dot{q}, \ddot{q})$, the remaining terms
disappear, leaving us with

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \delta_\eta S[q](t_a, t_b) & = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} ((DL) \circ \Gamma[q]) \delta_\eta\Gamma[q] \cr
    & = \int_{t_a}^{t_b} ((\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q]) - D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) + D^2(\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q]))\eta
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The goal was to find conditions under which the action is stationary, ie,
$\delta_\eta S[q](t_a, t_b) = 0$. For arbitrary $\eta$ with fixed endpoints,
this can only occur if the non-$\eta$ factor inside the integral is 0:

\begin{equation}
(\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q]) - D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) + D^2(\partial_3L \circ \Gamma[q]) = 0
\end{equation}

This is the result we were seeking.

*** Higher dimensions

To keep going, we have to integrate by parts once more for each new term of the
local tuple that the Lagrangian depends on. For each new term we gain a new
constraint:

\begin{equation}
D^{n-1}\eta(t_a) = D^{n-1}\eta(t_b) = 0
\end{equation}

And a new term in the ever-higher-dimensional Lagrange's equations:

\begin{equation}
  (-1)^{n} D^{n}(\partial_{n+1}L \circ \Gamma[q])
\end{equation}

The fully general Lagrange's equations are, for a Lagrangian that depends on
the local tuple up to the $n$th derivative of $q$:

\begin{equation}
  0 = \sum_{i = 0}^n(-1)^i D^{i}(\partial_{i+1}L \circ \Gamma[q])
\end{equation}

Constrained by, for all $i$ from 0 to $n-1$:

\begin{equation}
D^i\eta(t_a) = D^i\eta(t_b) = 0
\end{equation}

Equivalently, the constraint is that all derivatives of $q$ from $i$ to $n-1$
must remain constant at $t_a$ and $t_b$.

Exercise 1.13 implements a procedure that generates the residual required by
these higher-dimensional Lagrange equations in Scheme.

*** Preliminary Notes

I found this exercise to be challenging because I was searching for a particular
elegant form of the Lagrange equations for each system. Because the Lagrange
equations are residuals, any linear combination of the equations also has to
equal 0. In a few of the exercises below, I reached a solution that was
technically correct, but cluttered.

If I were using Lagrangian mechanics to develop a game, or to simulate motion in
some virtual world, I would just move on. But it seems that one of the tasks for
the learner in modern physics is to take transferable lessons from the
equations, and this means that it's important to try and unmask terms that might
appear in different systems under superficially different forms.

Exercise 1.14 has an example of this problem that took me a long time to notice.
The systems we analyze here happen to have yielded nice, familiar solutions. But
note now that this is not a gimme.

*** Part A: Ideal Planar Pendulum

From the book:

#+begin_quote
An ideal planar pendulum consists of a bob of mass $m$ connected to a pivot by a
massless rod of length $l$ subject to uniform gravitational acceleration $g$. A
Lagrangian is $L(t, \theta, \dot{\theta}) = {1 \over 2} ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 +
mgl\cos \theta$. The formal parameters of $L$ are $t$, $\theta$, and
$\dot{\theta}$; $\theta$ measures the angle of the pendulum rod to a plumb line
and $\dot{\theta}$ is the angular velocity of the rod.
#+end_quote

Here is the Lagrangian described by the exercise:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-pendulum m g l) local)
  (let ((theta (coordinate local))
        (theta_dot (velocity local)))
    (+ (* 1/2 m (square l) (square theta_dot))
       (* m g l (cos theta)))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

And the steps that lead us to Lagrange's equations:

The final entry is the Lagrange equation, equal to $0$. Divide out the shared
factors of $m$ and $l$:

*** Part B: 2D Potential

The next problem is in rectangular coordinates. This means that we'll end up
with two Lagrange equations that have to be satisfied.

From the book:

#+begin_quote
A particle of mass $m$ moves in a two-dimensional potential $V(x, y) = {(x^2 +
y^2) \over 2} + x^2 y - {y^3 \over 3}$, where $x$ and $y$ are rectangular
coordinates of the particle. A Lagrangian is $L(t;x, y; v_x, v_y) = {1 \over 2}
m (v_x^2 + v_y^2) - V(x, y)$.
#+end_quote

I have no intuition for /what/ this potential is, by the way. One term, ${x^2 +
y^2} \over 2$, looks like half the square of the distance of the particle away
from 0, or ${1 \over 2} r^2$. What are the other terms? I've been so well
trained that I simply start calculating.

Define the Lagrangian to be the difference of the kinetic energy and some
potential $V$ that has access to the coordinates:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (((L-2d-potential m) V) local)
  (- (* 1/2 m (square (velocity local)))
     (V (coordinate local))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| L-2d-potential |#

Thanks to the tuple algebra of =scmutils=, This form of the Lagrangian is
general enough that it would work for any number of dimensions in rectangular
space, given some potential $V$. =square= takes a dot product, so we end up with
a kinetic energy term for every spatial dimension.

Note this for later, as this idea will become useful when the book reaches the
discussion of coordinate transformations.

Next define the potential from the problem description:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (V q)
  (let ((x (ref q 0))
        (y (ref q 1)))
    (- (+ (/ (+ (square x)
                (square y))
             2)
          (* (square x) y))
       (/ (cube y) 3))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| V |#

Our helpful function generates the Lagrange equations, along with each
intermediate step:

\end{equation}

The final down-tuple gives us the Lagrange equations that $x$ and $y$
(respectively) must satisfy.

*** Part C: Particle on a Sphere

This problem is slightly more clear. From the book:

#+begin_quote
A Lagrangian for a particle of mass $m$ constrained to move on a sphere of
radius $R$ is $L(t; \theta, \phi; \alpha, \beta) = {1 \over 2} m
R^2(\alpha^2+(\beta \sin\theta)^2)$. The angle $\theta$ is the colatitude of the
particle and $\phi$ is the longitude; the rate of change of the colatitude is
$\alpha$ and the rate of change of the longitude is $\beta$.
#+end_quote

So the particle has some generalized kinetic energy with terms for:

- its speed north and south, and
- its speed east and west, scaled to be strongest at 0 longitude along the $x$
  axis and fall off to nothing at the $y$ axis.

Here is the Lagrangian:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-sphere m R) local)
  (let* ((q (coordinate local))
         (qdot (velocity local))
         (theta (ref q 0))
         (alpha (ref qdot 0))
         (beta (ref qdot 1)))
    (* 1/2 m (square R)
       (+ (square alpha)
          (square (* beta (sin theta)))))))
#+end_src

\end{equation}

The final Lagrange residuals have a few terms that we can divide out. Scheme
doesn't know that these are meant to be residuals, so it won't cancel out
factors that we can see by eye are missing.

Isolate the Lagrange equations from the derivation and manually simplify each
equation by dividing out, respectively, $mR^2$ and $mR^2 \sin \theta$:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((L (L-sphere 'm 'R))
       (theta (literal-function 'theta))
       (q (up theta (literal-function 'phi)))

  (let ((eq1 (ref le 0))
        (eq2 (ref le 1)))
    (->tex-equation
     ((up (/ eq1 (* 'm (square 'R)))
          (/ eq2 (* (sin theta) 'm (square 'R))))
      't))))
#+end_src

\end{equation}

These are the Lagrange equations for $\theta$ and $\phi$, respectively.

:END:

This exercise completes exercise 1.10 by asking for implementations of the
higher-order Lagrange equations that we derived. This was a nice Scheme
exercise; I would argue that this implementation should exist in the standard
library. But that would ruin the fun of the exercise...

*** Part A: Acceleration-dependent Lagrangian Implementation

From the book:

#+begin_quote
Write a procedure to compute the Lagrange equations for Lagrangians that depend
upon acceleration, as in exercise 1.10. Note that Gamma can take an optional
argument giving the length of the initial segment of the local tuple needed. The
default length is 3, giving components of the local tuple up to and including
the velocities.
#+end_quote

Now that we know the math, the implementation is a straightforward extension of
the =Lagrange-equations= procedure presented in the book:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((Lagrange-equations3 L) q)
  (let ((state-path (Gamma q 4)))
    (+ ((square D) (compose ((partial 3) L) state-path))
       (- (D (compose ((partial 2) L) state-path)))
       (compose ((partial 1) L) state-path))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| Lagrange-equations3 |#

*** Part B: Applying HO-Lagrangians

Now it's time to use the new function. From the book:

#+begin_quote
Use your procedure to compute the Lagrange equations for the Lagrangian

\begin{equation}
L(t, x, v, a) = - {1 \over 2}mxa - {1 \over 2}kx^2
\end{equation}

Do you recognize the resulting equation of motion?
#+end_quote

Here is the Lagrangian described in the problem:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-1-13 m k) local)
  (let ((x (coordinate local))
        (a (acceleration local)))
    (- (* -1/2 m x a)
       (* 1/2 k (square x)))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| L-1-13 |#

Use the new function to generate the Lagrange equations. This call includes a
factor of $-1$ to make the equation look nice:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 (- (((Lagrange-equations3 (L-1-13 'm 'k))
      (literal-function 'x)) 't)))

\begin{equation}
k x\left( t \right) + m {D}^{2}x\left( t \right)
\end{equation}

This looks like the equation of motion for a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_oscillator][classical harmonic oscillator]].
Again, I leave this problem with no new physical intuition for what is going on
here, or what type of system would need an acceleration dependent Lagrangian. I
suspect that we could build a harmonic oscillator for Lagrange equations of any
order by properly tuning the Lagrangian. But I don't know why this would be
helpful.

*** Part C: Generalized Lagrange Equations

Now, some more fun with Scheme. It just feels nice to implement Scheme
procedures. From the book:

#+begin_quote
For more fun, write the general Lagrange equation procedure that takes a
Lagrangian that depends on any number of derivatives, and the number of
derivatives, to produce the required equations of motion.
#+end_quote

As a reminder, this is the equation that we need to implement for each
coordinate:

\begin{equation}
  0 = \sum_{i = 0}^n(-1)^i D^{i}(\partial_{i+1}L \circ \Gamma[q])
\end{equation}

There are two ideas playing together here. Each term takes an element from:

- an alternating sequence of $1$ and $-1$
- a sequence of increasing-index $D^i(\partial_i L \circ \Gamma[q])$ terms

The alternating $1, -1$ sequence is similar to a more general idea: take any
ordered collection arranged in a cycle, start at some point and walk around the
cycle for $n$ steps.

If you need to take $n$ steps along a cycle of length $l$, you'll end up
traveling around the cycle between $n \over l$ and ${n \over l} + 1$ times.

=alternate= generates a list of $n$ total elements generated by walking around
the ordered cycle of supplied =elems=:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (cycle n elems)
  (apply append (make-list n elems)))

(define (alternating n elems)
  (let* ((l (length elems))
         (times (quotient (+ n (-1+ l)) l)))
    (list-head (cycle times elems) n)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| cycle |#
:
: #| alternating |#

Now, the general =Lagrange-equations*= implementation.

This function defines an internal function =term= that generates the $i$th term
of the derivative combination described above. This sequence is zipped with the
sequence of $1, -1$, and =fold-left= generates the sum.

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((Lagrange-equations* L n) q)
  (let ((state-path (Gamma q (1+ n))))
    (define (term i)
      ((expt D i)
       (compose ((partial (1+ i)) L) state-path)))
    (let ((terms (map term (iota n))))
      (fold-left (lambda (acc pair)
                   (+ acc (apply * pair)))
                 0
                 (zip (alternating n '(1 -1))
                      (reverse terms))))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| Lagrange-equations* |#

Generate the Lagrange equations from part b once more to check that we get the
same result:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 (- (((Lagrange-equations* (L-1-13 'm 'k) 3)

\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

There it is again, the harmonic oscillator. I don't have any intuition for
higher order Lagrangians, so I can't cook up any further examples to test the
implementation.

** Exercise 1.14: Coordinate-independence of Lagrange equations
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args+: :tangle ch1/ex1-14.scm :comments org
:END:

Look carefully at what this exercise is asking us to do:

#+begin_quote
Check that the Lagrange equations for central force motion in polar coordinates
and in rectangular coordinates are equivalent. Determine the relationship among
the second derivatives by substituting paths into the transformation equations
and computing derivatives, then substitute these relations into the equations of
motion.
#+end_quote

The punchline that we'll encounter soon is that a coordinate transformation of
applied to some path function $q$ can commute with $\Gamma$. You can always
write some function $C$ of the local tuple that handles the coordinate
transformation /after/ $\Gamma[q]$ instead of transforming the path directly. In
other words, you can always find some $C$ such that

\begin{equation}
C \circ \Gamma[q] = \Gamma[q']
\end{equation}

Because function composition is associative, instead of ever transforming the
path, you can push the coordinate transformation into the Lagrangian to generate
a new Lagrangian: $L = L' \circ C$.

The section of textbook just before the exercise has given us two Lagrangians in
different coordinates -- =L-central-polar= and =L-rectangular= -- and generated
Lagrange equations from each.

Our task is to directly transform the Lagrange equations by substituting the
first and second derivatives of the coordinate transformation expression into
one of the sets of equations, and looking to see that it's equivalent to the
other.

Fair warning: this is much more painful than transforming the Lagrangian
/before/ generating the Lagrange equations. This exercise continues the theme of
devastating you with algebra as a way to show you the horror that the later
techniques were developed to avoid. Let us proceed.

\end{equation}

Once again, our goal is to show that, if you can write down coordinate
transformations for the coordinates, velocities and accelerations and substitute
them in to one set of Lagrange equations, the other will appear.

To do this by hand, take the coordinate transformation described in 1.64 in the
book:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    x &= r \cos \phi \cr
    y &= r \sin \phi
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Note that $x$, $y$, $r$ and $\phi$ are functions of $t$. Take the derivative of
each equation (Use the product and chain rules) to obtain expressions for the
rectangular velocities in terms of the polar coordinates, just like equation
1.66 in the book:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    Dx(t) &= Dr(t) \cos \phi(t) - r(t) D\phi(t) \sin \phi(t) \cr
    Dy(t) &= Dr(t) \sin \phi(t) + r(t) D\phi(t) \cos \phi(t)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

The rectangular equations of motion have second derivatives, so we need to keep
going. This is too devastating to imagine doing by hand. Let's move to Scheme.

Write the coordinate transformation for polar coordinates to rectangular in
Scheme:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (p->r local)
  (let* ((polar-tuple (coordinate local))
         (r (ref polar-tuple 0))
         (phi (ref polar-tuple 1))
         (x (* r (cos phi)))
         (y (* r (sin phi))))
    (up x y)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| p->r |#

Now use =F->C=, first described on page 46. This is a function that takes a
coordinate transformation like =p->r= and returns a /new/ function that can
convert an entire local tuple from one coordinate system to another; the $C$
discussed above.

The version that the book presents on page 46 can only generate a velocity
transformation given a coordinate transformation, but =scmutils= contains a more
general version that will convert as many path elements as you pass to it.

Here are the rectangular positions, velocities and accelerations, written in
polar coordinates:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes

\end{equation}


Ordinarily, it would be too heartbreaking to substitute these in to the
rectangular equations of motion. The fact that we have Scheme on our side gives
me the strength to proceed.

Write the rectangular Lagrange equations as a function of the local tuple, so we
can call it directly:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (rect-equations local)
  (let* ((q (coordinate local))
         (x (ref q 0))
         (y (ref q 1))

         (xdot (ref v 0))
         (ydot (ref v 1))

         (a (acceleration local))
         (xdotdot (ref a 0))
         (ydotdot (ref a 1))

\end{equation}

Oh no. This looks quite different from the polar Lagrange equations above. What
is the problem?

I had to stare at this for a long time before I saw what to do. Notice that the
terms we want from the polar Lagrange equations all seem to appear in the first
equation with a $\cos \phi$, and in the second equation with a $\sin \phi$.
Using the trigonometric identity:

\begin{equation}
(\cos \phi)^2 + (\sin \phi)^2 = 1
\end{equation}

I realized that I could recover the first equation through a linear combination
of both terms. Multiply the first by $\cos \phi$ and the second by $\sin \phi$,
add them together and the unwanted terms all drop away.

A similar trick recovers the second equation,given an extra factor of $r$:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes

       (polar-path (up 't

\end{equation}

This was a powerful lesson. We're allowed to take a linear combination here
because each equation is a residual, equal to zero. $a0 + b0 = 0$ for any $a$
and $b$, so any combination we generate is still a valid residual.

There is something important going on here, with the way we were able to remove
$\phi$ completely from the Lagrange equations. It seemed like $\phi$ was quite
important, until we managed to kill it. Is this related to the discussions of
symmetries that we'll encounter later in the book? Let me know if you know the
answer here.

This is one of the more important exercises in the chapter. The problem asks for
a proof that it's possible to absorb a coordinate transformation directly into
the Lagrangian. If you can do this, you can express your paths and your forces
in whatever coordinates you like, so long as you can transition between them.

I also found that this exposed, and repaired, my weakness with the [[http://fmnt.info/blog/20180228_sicm/index.html#orga0630c4][functional
notation]] that Sussman and Wisdom have used in the book.

The problem states:

#+begin_quote
Show by direct calculation that the Lagrange equations for $L'$ are satisfied if
the Lagrange equations for $L$ are satisfied.
#+end_quote

*** Definitions and Preliminaries

$L'$ and $L$ refer to ideas from section 1.6.1. The major promise of Lagrangian
mechanics is that both the potential and kinetic energies are
coordinate-independent; looking at the system through different coordinates
can't affect the energy in the system, or you've dropped some information in the
conversation. If this is true, then the value of the Lagrangian, equal to $T -
V$, must be coordinate independent too.

Imagine a coordinate transformation $F$, maybe time-dependent, that can convert
"primed coordinates" like $x'$ into "unprimed coordinates", $x$:

\begin{equation}
x = F(t, x')
\end{equation}

You might imagine that $x'$ is in polar coordinates and $x$ is in rectangular
coordinates. Time-dependence means that the coordinate system itself is moving
around in time. Imagine looking at the world out of a spinning window.

Now imagine some Lagrangian $L$ that acts on a local tuple built out of the
unprimed coordinates. If the Lagrangian's value is coordinate-independent, there
must be some other form, $L'$, that can act on the primed coordinates. $L'$ has
to satisfy:

\begin{equation}
L' \circ \Gamma[q'] = L \circ \Gamma[q]
\end{equation}

The function $F$ only acts on specific coordinates. Imagine a function $C$ that
uses $F$ to transform the entire local tuple from the primed coordinates to the
unprimed coordinates:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1-15-relations}
L \circ \Gamma[q] = L \circ C \circ \Gamma[q'] = L' \circ \Gamma[q']
\end{equation}

Function composition is associative, so two facts stare at us from
\eqref{eq:1-15-relations}:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
L' & = L \circ C \cr
\Gamma[q] & = C \circ \Gamma[q']
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This implies that if we want describe our path in some primed coordinate system
(imagine polar coordinates), but we only have a Lagrangian defined in an
unprimed coordinate system (like rectangular coordinates), if we can just write
down $C$ we can generate a new Lagrangian $L'$ by composing our old $L$ with
$C$. This brings us to the exercise.

The goal is to show that if the Lagrange equations hold in the unprimed
coordinate system:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1-15-lagrange}
D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) - (\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q]) = 0
\end{equation}

Then they hold in the primed coordinate system:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:lagrange-prime}
D(\partial_2L' \circ \Gamma[q']) - (\partial_1L' \circ \Gamma[q']) = 0
\end{equation}

*** Approach

The approach we'll take will be to:

- Write down the form of $C$, given some arbitrary $F$
- start calculating the terms of the Lagrange equations in the primed coordinate
  system using $L' = L \circ C$
- Keep an eye out for some spot where we can use our assumption that the
  Lagrange equations hold in the unprimed coordinates.

I'll walk through a solution using "pen and paper", then show how we can run
this derivation using Scheme to help us along.

First, some Scheme tools that will help us in both cases.

*** Scheme Tools

Equation (1.77) in the book describes how to implement $C$ given some arbitrary
$F$. Looking ahead slightly, this is implemented as =F->C= on page 46.

The following function is a slight redefinition that allows us to use an $F$
that takes an explicit $(t, x')$, instead of the entire local tuple:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((F->C* F) local)
  (let ((t (time local))
        (x (coordinate local))
        (v (velocity local)))
    (up t
        (F t x)
        (+ (((partial 0) F) t x)
           (* (((partial 1) F) t x)
              v)))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[8ea33eda9107b7b0d6ce890f316eb453b2d96fca]:
: #| F->C* |#

Next we define $F$, $C$ and $L$ as described above, as well as =qprime=, a
function that can represent our unprimed coordinate path function.

The types here all imply that the path has one real coordinate. I did this to
make the types easier to understand; the derivation applies equally well to
paths with many dimensions.

#+begin_src scheme
(define F
  (literal-function 'F (-> (X Real Real) Real)))

(define C (F->C* F))

(define L
  (literal-function 'L (-> (UP Real Real Real) Real)))

(define qprime
  (literal-function 'qprime))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| F |#
:
: #| C |#
:
: #| L |#
:
: #| qprime |#

When we apply $C$ to the primed local tuple, do we get the transformed tuple
that we expect from 1.77 in the book?

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 ((compose C (Gamma qprime)) 't))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[ecef7fe872de385af827c689dbd0db76aa5319f0]:

\end{equation}

This looks correct. We can also transform the path before passing it to
$\Gamma$:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((to-q F qp) t)
  (F t (qp t)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| to-q |#

Subtract the two forms to see that they're equivalent:

\end{equation}

Now that we know $C$ is correct we can define $q$, the unprimed coordinate path
function, and =Lprime=:

#+begin_src scheme
(define q (to-q F qprime))
(define Lprime (compose L C))
#+end_src

*** Derivation

Begin by calculating the components of the Lagrange equations in equation
\eqref{eq:lagrange-prime}. Examine the $\partial_2L'$ term first.

As we discussed above, function composition is associative, so:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:c-l}
(L \circ C) \circ \Gamma[q'] = L' \circ \Gamma[q'] \implies L' = L \circ C
\end{equation}

Substituting $L'$ from \eqref{eq:c-l} and using the chain rule:

\begin{equation}
  \partial_2L' = \partial_2(L \circ C) = ((DL) \circ C) \partial_2 C
\end{equation}

I found the next step troubling until I became more comfortable with the
functional notation.

$C$ is a function that transforms a local tuple. It takes 3 arguments (a tuple
with 3 elements, technically) and returns 3 arguments. $\partial_2 C$ is an
up-tuple with 3 entries. Each entry describes the derivative each component of
$C$'s output with respect to the velocity component of the local tuple.

$L$ is a function that transforms the 3-element local to a scalar output. $DL$
is a down-tuple with 3 entries. Each entry describes the derivative of the
single output with respect to each entry of the local tuple.

The tuple algebra described in Chapter 9 defines multiplication between an up
and down tuple as a dot product, or a "contraction" in the book's language. This
means that we can expand out the product above:

\begin{equation}
  (DL \circ C)\partial_2 C = (\partial_0L \circ C)(I_0 \circ \partial_2 C) + (\partial_1L \circ C)(I_1 \circ \partial_2 C) + (\partial_2L \circ C)(I_2 \circ \partial_2 C)
\end{equation}

$I_0$, $I_1$ and $I_2$ are "selectors" that return that single element of the
local tuple.

Example the value of $\partial_2C$ using our Scheme utilities:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 (((partial 2) C) (up 't 'xprime 'vprime))
 "eq:p2c")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[2ad70f16eca982284368a2f70f31de3b2de41025]:
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \displaystyle{ 0} \cr \cr \displaystyle{ 0} \cr \cr \displaystyle{ {\partial}_{1}F\left( t, {x}^\prime \right)}\end{pmatrix}
\label{eq:p2c}
\end{equation}

The first two components are 0, leaving us with:

\begin{equation}
  \partial_2 L' = (DL \circ C)\partial_2 C = (\partial_2L \circ C)(I_2 \circ \partial_2 C)
\end{equation}

Compose this quantity with $\Gamma[q']$ and distribute the composition into the
product. Remember that $C \circ \Gamma[q'] = \Gamma[q]$:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial_2L' \circ \Gamma[q'] & = (\partial_2L \circ C)(I_2 \circ \partial_2 C) \circ \Gamma[q'] \cr
    & = (\partial_2L \circ C \circ \Gamma[q'])(I_2 \circ \partial_2 C \circ \Gamma[q']) \cr
    & = (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])(I_2 \circ \partial_2 C \circ \Gamma[q'])
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Take the derivative (with respect to time, remember, from the types):

\begin{equation}
  D(\partial_2L' \circ \Gamma[q']) = D\left[(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])(I_2 \circ \partial_2 C \circ \Gamma[q'])\right]
\end{equation}

Substitute the second term using \eqref{eq:p2c}:

\begin{equation}
  D(\partial_2L' \circ \Gamma[q']) = D\left[(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])\partial_1F(t, q'(t))\right]
\end{equation}

Expand using the product rule:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ex1-15-dp2l}
  D(\partial_2L' \circ \Gamma[q']) = \left[ D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) \right]\partial_1F(t, q'(t)) + (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])D\left[ \partial_1F(t, q'(t)) \right]
\end{equation}

A term from the unprimed Lagrange's equation is peeking. Notice this, but don't
make the substitution just yet.

Next, expand the $\partial_1 L'$ term:

\begin{equation}
  \partial_1L' = \partial_1(L \circ C) = ((DL) \circ C) \partial_1 C
\end{equation}

Calculate $\partial_1C$ using our Scheme utilities:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 (((partial 1) C) (up 't 'xprime 'vprime)))
#+end_src

\end{equation}

Expand the chain rule out and remove 0 terms, as before:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \partial_1L' & = ((DL) \circ C) \partial_1 C \cr
    & = (\partial_0L \circ C)(I_0 \circ \partial_1 C) + (\partial_1L \circ C)(I_1 \circ \partial_1 C) + (\partial_2L \circ C)(I_2 \circ \partial_1 C) \cr
    & = (\partial_1L \circ C)(I_1 \circ \partial_1 C) + (\partial_2L \circ C)(I_2 \circ \partial_1 C)
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Compose $\Gamma[q']$ and distribute:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \partial_1L' \circ \Gamma[q'] & = (\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q])(I_1 \circ \partial_1 C \circ \Gamma[q']) + (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])(I_2 \circ \partial_1 C \circ \Gamma[q']) \cr
& = (\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q])(\partial_1F(t, q'(t))) + (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])D(\partial_1F(t, q'(t)))
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We now have both components of the primed Lagrange equations from
\eqref{eq:lagrange-prime}.

Subtract the two terms, extract common factors and use our assumption
\eqref{eq:1-15-lagrange} that the original Lagrange equations hold:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  D(\partial_2L' \circ \Gamma[q']) - (\partial_1L' \circ \Gamma[q']) & = \left[ D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) - (\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q]) \right] \partial_1F(t, q'(t)) \cr
  & + \left[ (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q])  - (\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) \right] D(\partial_1F(t, q'(t))) \cr
& = \left[ D(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) - (\partial_1L \circ \Gamma[q]) \right] \partial_1F(t, q'(t)) \cr
& = 0
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

And boom, we're done! The primed Lagranged equations \eqref{eq:lagrange-prime}
hold if the unprimed equations \eqref{eq:1-15-lagrange} hold.

I'm not sure what to make of the new constant terms. The new Lagrange equations
are scaled by $\partial_1 F(t, q'(t))$, the derivative of $F$ with respect to
the path; that seems interesting, and possibly there's some nice physical
intuition waiting to be discovered.

*** Scheme Derivation

Can we use Scheme to pursue the same derivation? If we can write the
relationships of the derivation in code, then we'll have a sort of computerized
proof that the primed Lagrange equations are valid.

First, consider $\partial_1 L' \circ \Gamma[q']$:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation

\end{equation}

This is completely insane, and already unhelpful. The argument to $L$, we know,
is actually $\Gamma[q]$. Make a function that will replace the tuple with that
reference:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (->eq expr)
  (write-string
   (replace-all (->tex-equation* expr)

Ignore the parentheses around $\circ \Gamma[q]$ and this looks better.

This, again, is total madness. We really want some way to control how Scheme
expands terms.

But we know what we're looking for. Expand out the matching term of the unprimed
Lagrange equations:

Staring at these two equations, it becomes clear that the first contains the
second, multiplied by $\partial_1F(t, q'(t))$, the same factor that appeared in
the expansion of the $\partial_1 L \circ \Gamma[q]$ term.

Try writing out the primed Lagrange equations, and subtracting the unprimed
Lagrange equations, scaled by this factor:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes

        (- (D (compose ((partial 2) Lprime) (Gamma qprime)))

           (compose ((partial 1) L) (Gamma q))))

Done! It seems that the extra terms on each side exactly cancel. As with the pen
and paper derivation, we've shown that the primed Lagranged equations
\eqref{eq:lagrange-prime} hold if the unprimed equations
\label{eq:1-15-lagrange} hold.

*** Final Comments

I'm troubled by my lack of intuition around two ideas:

- what is the meaning of the $\partial_1F(t, q'(t))$ scaling factor?
- Both sides acquire a constant $(\partial_2L \circ \Gamma[q]) \cdot
  D(\partial_1F(t, q'(t)))$.

The right factor is a total time derivative. Is this meaningful? We know from
later discussion that if we add a total time derivative to the Lagrangian we
don't affect the shape of the realizable path.

I learned quite a bit about functional notation from this exercise, and I think
that test that the result represents is critical for leaning hard on the
coordinate transformations that we'll continue to explore. But I do feel like
I'm leaving intuitive cake on the table.

This exercise gives you practice in writing Lagrangians as compositions.

#+begin_quote
Find Lagrangians for central force motion in three dimensions in rectangular
coordinates and in spherical coordinates. First, find the Lagrangians
analytically, then check the results with the computer by generalizing the
programs that we have presented.
#+end_quote

*** Analytic Approach

Analytically in 3d coordinates, we have a straightforward extension:

\begin{equation}
L = T - V = {1 \over 2} m (v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2) - U(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2})
\end{equation}

How would you find the spherical Lagrangian analytically?

The potential part is easy. We know that $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$, so the
final Lagrangian will have a $U(r)$ term.

To transform the kinetic energies:

- write down the coordinate transformation from spherical to rectangular:
- get the velocity components by taking derivatives, chain rule
- substitute these in to the rectangular Lagrangian

This is equivalent to generating $L' = L \circ C$, where $C$ is a function that
substitutes each position $x, y, z$ or velocity $v_x, v_y, v_z$ for its
spherical representation. $L'$ is the spherical Lagrangian, $L$ is the
rectangular.

How do you get the velocities?

Remember, from equation 1.77 in the book:

\begin{equation}
C(t, x', v') = (t,\, F(t, x'),\, \partial_0F(t, x') + \partial_1F(t, x')v')
\end{equation}

$F(t, x')$ is the conversion from spherical to rectangular coordinates. $x'$ is
a 3-tuple of $(r, \theta, \phi)$, and $F(t, x')$ is a 3-tuple $(x, y, z)$, where:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  x & = r \sin \theta \cos \phi \cr
  y & = r \sin \theta \sin \phi \cr
  z & = r \cos \theta
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

It's important to remember that the partials in equation 1.77 are taken as if
the arguments were static. The chain rule has already been applied. It's more
san

\begin{equation}
\partial_0F(t, x') = (0, 0, 0)
\end{equation}

This has three components; one for each of the components in the return value.

$\partial_1F(t, x')$ is a tuple with three components, each of which /also/ has
three components, one for each of the spherical coordinates.

The inner tuples collapse upon multiplication by $v' = (\dot{r}, \dot{\theta},
\dot{\phi})$, leaving:

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    v_x & = \dot{r} \sin \theta \cos \phi + r \dot{\theta} \cos \theta \cos \phi + r \dot{\phi} \sin \theta \sin \phi \cr
    v_y & = \dot{r} \sin \theta \sin \phi + r \dot{\theta} \cos \theta \sin \phi + r \dot{\phi} \sin \theta \cos \phi \cr
    v_z & = \dot{r} \cos \theta + r \dot{\theta} \sin \theta
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Substituting these in results, eventually, in a waterfall of cancellations and
leaves:

\begin{equation}
L' = {1 \over 2} m (r^2 \dot{\phi}^2 \sin^2\phi + r^2 \dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{r}^2) - U(r)
\end{equation}

*** Scheme Approach

To show the rectangular Lagrangian, get the procedure from page 41:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-central-rectangular m U) local)
  (let ((q (coordinate local))
        (v (velocity local)))
    (- (* 1/2 m (square v))
       (U (sqrt (square q))))))
#+end_src

This is already written in a form that can handle an arbitrary number of
coordinates. Confirm the rectangular Lagrangian by passing in a local tuple with
3 dimensional coordinates and velocities:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(->tex-equation
 ((L-central-rectangular 'm (literal-function 'U))
  (up 't
      (up 'x 'y 'z)

#+end_src

\end{equation}


Next, the spherical. Write down the coordinate transformation from spherical to
rectangular coordinates as a Scheme procedure:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (spherical->rect local)
  (let* ((q (coordinate local))
         (r (ref q 0))
         (theta (ref q 1))
         (phi (ref q 2)))
    (up (* r (sin theta) (cos phi))
        (* r (sin theta) (sin phi))
        (* r (cos theta)))))

#+end_src

\end{equation}


Now that we have $L$ and $C$, we can compose them to get $L'$, our spherical
Lagrangian:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (L-central-spherical m U)
  (compose (L-central-rectangular m U)
           (F->C spherical->rect)))
#+end_src

\end{equation}

*** Discussion

Langrangian coordinate transformation from spherical -> rectangular on paper,
which of course is a total nightmare, writing vx^2 + vy^2 + vz^2 and
simplifying. BUT then, of course, you write down the spherical => rectangular
position change...

the explicit link to function composition, and how the new lagrangian is
(Lagrangian A + A<-B + B<-C)... really drives home how coordinate transforms can
stack associatively through function composition. the lesson is, prove that the
code works, then trust the program to go to crazy coordinate systems.

Later, the authors add in a very simple-to-write coordinate transform that has
one of the angles depend on t. and then compose that in, and boom, basically for
free you're in rotating spherical coords.

This, and the next three exercises, are here to give you practice in the real
art, of difficulty, of any dynamics problem. It's easy to change coordinates. So
what coordinates do you use?

#+begin_quote
A bead of mass $m$ is constrained to move on a frictionless helical wire. The
helix is oriented so that its axis is horizontal. The diameter of the helix is
$d$ and its pitch (turns per unit length) is $h$. The system is in a uniform
gravitational field with vertical acceleration $g$. Formulate a Lagrangian that
describes the system and find the Lagrange equations of motion.

I'll replace this with a better picture later, but this is the setup:

#+begin_quote
The two-bar linkage shown in figure 1.3 is constrained to move in the plane. It
is composed of three small massive bodies interconnected by two massless rigid
rods in a uniform gravitational field with vertical acceleration g. The rods are
pinned to the central body by a hinge that allows the linkage to fold. The
system is arranged so that the hinge is completely free: the members can go
through all configurations without collision. Formulate a Lagrangian that
describes the system and find the Lagrange equations of motion. Use the computer
to do this, because the equations are rather big.
#+end_quote

This is new. Now we have multiple bodies:

[[file:images/Lagrangian_Mechanics/2020-06-29_05-39-01_Art_P146.jpg]]

We can handle this by treating our coordinate space as having new dimensions
for, say, $x_0$, $y_0$, $x_1$, $y_1$. The fact that multiple coordinates refer
to the same particle doesn't matter for the Lagrangian. But it's a confusing
API.

/Without/ any constraints, we have six degrees of freedom. $x, y$ for each
particle. With the constraints we have:

1) $x, y$ for the central body
2) $\theta$ and $\phi$ for the angles off center.

(Sketch these out on the picture for the final version.)

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  x_2(t) & = x_2(t) \cr
  y_2(t) & = y_2(t) \cr
  x_1(t) & = x_2(t) + l_1 \sin \theta \cr
  y_1(t) & = y_2(t) - l_1 \cos \theta \cr
  x_3(t) & = x_2(t) + l_2 \sin \phi \cr
  y_3(t) & = y_2(t) - l_2 \cos \phi
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Sketch out why this makes sense. Each angle is positive CCW for consistency,
since they can swing all the way around.

Consider a pendulum of length $l$ attached to a support that is free to move
horizontally, as shown in figure 1.4. Let the mass of the support be $m1$ and
the mass of the pendulum bob be $m2$. Formulate a Lagrangian and derive
Lagrange's equations for this system.

This is interesting, and totally not-obvious how to represent with Newtonian
mechanics. Here it is pretty simple. The setup:

We can use 2 coordinates:

1. the horizontal position of the cart
2. the angle $\theta$ of the bob.

Here's the conversion to rectangular:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  x_1(t) & = x_1(t) \cr
  y_1(t) & = l \cr
  x_2(t) & = x_1(t) + l \sin \theta \cr
  y_2(t) & = l(1 - \cos \theta)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Draw these on the picture to make it clearer.

** Exercise 1.21: A dumbbell
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args+: :tangle ch1/ex1-21.scm :comments org
:END:

The uneven dumbbell. We've just made it through four exercises which embrace the
idea that you can bake constraints into the coordinate transformation. But why
should we believe that this is allowed?

This exercise comes after a section called "Why it Works".

The next exercise tries to do a coordinate change that is really careful about
/not/ changing the dimension of the configuration space, so that we can show
that this move is allowed. Here's the setup:

The idea here is to take the distance between the particles $l$ and treat it as
a new dimension $c$.

Goal is to assume that Newtonian mechanics' approach to constraints, shown [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_dynamics#Constraint_forces][here]],
I think, is correct, and then show that the resulting equations of motion let us
treat the distance coordinate $c$ as a constant.

Takes in any number of up tuples and zips them into a new list of up-tuples by
taking each element.

*** Multiple Particle API

Many exercises have been dealing with multiple particles so far. Let's introduce
some functions that let us pluck the appropriate coordinates out of the local
tuple.

If we have the velocity and mass of a particle, its kinetic energy is easy to
define:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (KE-particle m v)
  (* 1/2 m (square v)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| KE-particle |#

This next function, =extract-particle=, takes a number of components -- 2 for a
particle with 2 components, 3 for a particle in space, etc -- and returns a
function of =local= and =i=, a particle index. This function can be used to
extract a sub-local-tuple for that particle from a flattened list.

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((extract-particle pieces) local i)
  (let* ((indices (apply up (iota pieces (* i pieces))))
         (extract (lambda (tuple)
                    (vector-map (lambda (i)
                                  (ref tuple i))
                                indices))))
    (up (time local)
        (extract (coordinate local))
        (extract (velocity local)))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| extract-particle |#

*** Part A: Newton's Equations

#+begin_quote
Write Newton's equations for the balance of forces for the four rectangular
coordinates of the two particles, given that the scalar tension in the rod is
$F$.
#+end_quote

TODO: Write these down from the notebook.

*** Part B: Dumbbell Lagrangian

#+begin_quote
Write the formal Lagrangian

\begin{equation}
L(t; x_0, y_0, x_1, y_1, F; \dot{x}_0, \dot{y}_0, \dot{x}_1, \dot{y}_1, \dot{F})
\end{equation}

such that Lagrange's equations will yield the Newton's equations you derived in
part *a*.
#+end_quote


Here is how we model constraint forces. Each pair of particles has some
constraint potential acting between them:

#+name: U-constraint
#+begin_src scheme
(define (U-constraint q0 q1 F l)
  (* (/ F (* 2 l))
     (- (square (- q1 q0))
        (square l))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| U-constraint |#

And here's a Lagrangian for two free particles, subject to a constraint
potential $F$ acting between them.

#+name: L-free-constrained
#+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-free-constrained m0 m1 l) local)
  (let* ((extract (extract-particle 2))
         (p0 (extract local 0))
         (q0 (coordinate p0))
         (qdot0 (velocity p0))

         (p1 (extract local 1))
         (q1 (coordinate p1))
         (qdot1 (velocity p1))

         (F (ref (coordinate local) 4)))
    (- (+ (KE-particle m0 qdot0)
          (KE-particle m1 qdot1))
       (U-constraint q0 q1 F l))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| L-free-constrained |#

Finally, the path. This is rectangular coordinates for each piece, plus $F$
between them.

#+begin_src scheme
(define q-rect
  (up (literal-function 'x_0)
      (literal-function 'y_0)
      (literal-function 'x_1)
      (literal-function 'y_1)
      (literal-function 'F)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| q-rect |#

This shows the lagrangian itself, which answers part b:

*** Part C: Coordinate Change

#+begin_quote
Make a change of coordinates to a coordinate system with center of mass
coordinates $x_{CM}$, $y_{CM}$, angle $\theta$, distance between the particles
$c$, and tension force $F$. Write the Lagrangian in these coordinates, and write
the Lagrange equations.
#+end_quote

This is a coordinate change that is very careful not to reduce the degrees of
freedom.

First, the coordinate change:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((cm-theta->rect m0 m1) local)
  (let* ((q (coordinate local))
         (x_cm (ref q 0))
         (y_cm (ref q 1))
         (theta (ref q 2))
         (c (ref q 3))
         (F (ref q 4))
         (total-mass (+ m0 m1))
         (m0-distance (* c (/ m1 total-mass)))
         (m1-distance (* c (/ m0 total-mass))))
    (up (- x_cm (* m0-distance (cos theta)))
        (- y_cm (* m0-distance (sin theta)))
        (+ x_cm (* m1-distance (cos theta)))
        (+ y_cm (* m1-distance (sin theta)))
        F)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| cm-theta->rect |#

Then the coordinate change applied to the local tuple:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let ((local (up 't

Then the Lagrangian in the new coordinates;

That final equation states that $c(t) = l$. Amazing!

*** Part D: Substitute $c(t) = l$

#+begin_quote
You may deduce from one of these equations that $c(t) = l$. From this fact we
get that $Dc = 0$ and $D^2c = 0$. Substitute these into the Lagrange equations
you just computed to get the equation of motion for $x_{CM}$, $y_{CM}$,
$\theta$.
#+end_quote

We can substitute the constant value of $c$ using a function that always returns
$l$ to get simplified equations:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes

\end{equation}

This is saying that the acceleration on the center of mass is 0.

The fourth equation, the equation of motion for the $c(t)$, is interesting here.
We need to pull in the definition of "reduced mass" from exercise 1.11:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (reduced-mass m1 m2)
  (/ (* m1 m2)
     (+ m1 m2)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| reduced-mass |#

If we let $m$ be the reduced mass, this equation states:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:constraint-force}
F(t) = m l \dot{\theta}^2
\end{equation}

We can verify this with Scheme by subtracting the two equations:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((F (literal-function 'F))

*** Part E: New Lagrangian

#+begin_quote
Make a Lagrangian ($= T − V$) for the system described with the irredundant
generalized coordinates $x_{CM}$, $y_{CM}$, $\theta$ and compute the Lagrange
equations from this Lagrangian. They should be the same equations as you derived
for the same coordinates in part d.
#+end_quote

For part e, I wrote this in the notebook - it is effectively identical to the
substitution that is happening on the computer, so I'm going to ignore this. You
just get more cancellations.

But let's go at it, for fun.

Here's the Lagrangian of 2 free particles:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-free2 m0 m1) local)
  (let* ((extract (extract-particle 2))

         (p0 (extract local 0))
         (q0 (coordinate p0))
         (qdot0 (velocity p0))

         (p1 (extract local 1))
         (q1 (coordinate p1))
         (qdot1 (velocity p1)))
    (+ (KE-particle m0 qdot0)
       (KE-particle m1 qdot1))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

Then a version of =cm-theta->rect= where we ignore $F$, and sub in a constant
$l$:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes

Show that the Lagrangian (1.93) can be used to describe the driven pendulum
(section 1.6.2), where the position of the pivot is a specified function of
time: Derive the equations of motion using the Newtonian constraint force
prescription, and show that they are the same as the Lagrange equations. Be sure
to examine the equations for the constraint forces as well as the position of
the pendulum bob.
#+end_quote

I might be slightly misunderstanding this question. The problem states that we
should use equations 1.91 and 1.92 in the book to express the equations of
motion of the driven pendulum, and then to rederive the equations of motion
using the Lagrangian.

The final note about examining the constraint forces means that we'll need to
follow the approach of equation 1.21 and include a coordinate transformation
from some $c(t)$, and then substitute $c(t) = l$ down the road.

*** Part A: Newton's Equations

Step one is to use 1.91 and 1.92 in the book to express $F = ma$. The only
potential is a uniform gravitational potential:

\begin{equation}
V(t, \theta, \dot{\theta}) = m g (y_s(t) - l \cos \theta)
\end{equation}

So equation 1.91 becomes, for the single pendulum bob:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
m D^2x(t) & = F(t) {{-x(t)} \over l} \cr
m D^2y(t) & = -mgl + F(t) {{y_s(t) - y(t)} \over l}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The assumption here is that the pendulum support sits at $(0, y_s(t))$.


*** Part B: Lagrangian

Now write the Lagrangian for the driven pendulum in rectangular coordinates. The
constraint force takes the same shape as in exercise 1.21:

#+begin_src scheme :noweb yes
<<U-constraint>>
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| U-constraint |#

The Lagrangian is similar, but only involves a single particle -- the pendulum
bob. We can generate the constraint force by directly building the support's
coordinates, rather than extracting them from the local tuple.

#+name: L-driven-free
#+begin_src scheme
(define ((L-driven-free m l y U) local)
  (let* ((extract (extract-particle 2))
         (bob (extract local 0))
         (q (coordinate bob))
         (qdot (velocity bob))
         (F (ref (coordinate local) 2)))
    (- (KE-particle m qdot)
       (U q)
       (U-constraint (up 0 (y (time local)))
                     q
                     F
                     l))))
#+end_src

Here is the now-familiar equation for a uniform gravitational potential, acting
on the $y$ coordinate:

#+name: U-gravity
#+begin_src scheme
(define ((U-gravity g m) q)
  (let* ((y (ref q 1)))
    (* m g y)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| U-gravity |#

Now use the new Lagrangian to generate equations of motion for the three
coordinates $x$, $y$ and $F$:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((q (up (literal-function 'x)
              (literal-function 'y)

       (U (U-gravity 'g 'm))
       (y (literal-function 'y_s))
       (L (L-driven-free 'm 'l y U))
       (f ((Lagrange-equations L) q)))
  (->tex-equation
   (f 't)))
#+end_src

\end{equation}

The first two equations of motion match the equations we derived in part A,
using Newton's equations. The third states that

\begin{equation}
l^2 = x(t)^2 + (y_s(t) - y(t))^&2
\end{equation}

Verified, with some extra terms to force the simplification:

*** Part C: Coordinate Change

Now we want to verify that we get the same Lagrangian and equations of motion as
in 1.88 from the book. We also want to analyze the constraint forces. To do this
we need to introduce a coordinate change.

To analyze the constraint forces, we have to do the same trick as in exercise
1.21 and use a coordinate $c(t) = l$. The new coordinates are $(\theta, c, F)$:

#+name: driven-polar->rect
#+begin_src scheme
(define ((driven-polar->rect y) local)
  (let* ((q (coordinate local))
         (theta (ref q 0))
         (c (ref q 1))
         (F (ref q 2)))
    (up (* c (sin theta))
        (- (y (time local)) (* c (cos theta)))
        F)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| driven-polar->rect |#

Compose the coordinate change with the rectangular Lagrangian:

#+name: L-driven-pend
#+begin_src scheme
(define (L-driven-pend m l y U)
  (compose (L-driven-free m l y U)
           (F->C (driven-polar->rect y))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: #| L-driven-pend |#

Examine the Lagrangian itself, after the coordinate transformation. (Notice that
we're using a constant function for $c(t)$ that always returns $l$.)

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((q (up (literal-function 'theta)
              (lambda (t) 'l)
              (literal-function 'F)))
       (y (literal-function 'y_s))
       (L (L-driven-pend 'm 'l y (U-gravity 'g 'm)))
       (f (compose L (Gamma q))))
  (->tex-equation
   (f 't)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[306c957e09bfd22ebe85e5c6fb9380ff977df1e9]:
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

Looks just like equation 1.88.

Next, examine the Lagrange equations, using the same substitution of $c(t) = l$:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let* ((q (up (literal-function 'theta)
              (lambda (t) 'l)
              (literal-function 'F)))
       (y (literal-function 'y_s))
       (L (L-driven-pend 'm 'l y (U-gravity 'g 'm)))
       (f ((Lagrange-equations L) q)))
  (->tex-equation
   (f 't)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[f9c380046af367934c5d46dd0d3793a1082a018e]:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} \displaystyle{ g l m \sin\left( \theta\left( t \right) \right) + {l}^{2} m {D}^{2}\theta\left( t \right) + l m {D}^{2}{y}_{s}\left( t \right) \sin\left( \theta\left( t \right) \right)} \cr \cr \displaystyle{  - l m {\left( D\theta\left( t \right) \right)}^{2} - g m \cos\left( \theta\left( t \right) \right) - m {D}^{2}{y}_{s}\left( t \right) \cos\left( \theta\left( t \right) \right) + F\left( t \right)} \cr \cr \displaystyle{ 0}\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

The third equation is 0 because of the substitution of constant $c(t) = l$. The
first equation of motion, for $\theta$, is identical to the equation on page 52.

The second equation describes the constraint force on the driven pendulum as a
function of the other coordinates and the support position.

*** part A

nice, easy to guess.

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((FA m) local)
  (let ((x (coordinate local)))
    (* m x)))
#+end_src

Show the function of t, and confirm that both methods are equivalent.

#+begin_src scheme
(check-f (FA 'm)
         (literal-function 'x))
#+end_src

*** Part B

NOT a total time derivative.

Define G directly:

#+begin_src scheme
(define ((GB m) local)
  (let* ((t (time local))
         (v_x (velocity local))
         (GB0 0)
         (GB1 (* m (cos t))))
    (+ GB0 (* GB1 v_x))))
#+end_src

And show the full G, for fun:

#+begin_src scheme
(let ((f (compose (GB 'm) (Gamma (literal-function 'x)))))
  (se (f 't)))
#+end_src


It's easier to confirm that this is not a total time derivative by checking the
partials.

#+begin_src scheme
(define (GB-properties m)
  (let ((GB0 (lambda (local) 0))
        (GB1 (lambda (local)
               (* m (cos (time local))))))
    (G-properties GB0 GB1 (literal-function 'x))))
#+end_src

It's clear here that the second and third tuple entries aren't equal, so we
don't have a total time derivative.

#+begin_src scheme
(se (GB-properties 'm))
#+end_src

*** Part C

no problem, we've got a total time derivative on our hands.

#+begin_src scheme
(define (FC local)
  (let ((t (time local))
        (x (coordinate local)))
    (* x (cos t))))

(check-f FC (literal-function 'x))

(define GC-properties
  (let ((GC0 (lambda (local)
               (* -1
                  (coordinate local)
                  (sin (time local)))))
        (GC1 (lambda (local)
               (cos (time local)))))
    (G-properties GC0 GC1 (literal-function 'x))))
#+end_src

Boom, the second and third entries are equal, as we'd expect.

#+begin_src scheme
(se GC-properties)
#+end_src


*** Part D

This is NOT a total time derivative; you can tell by taking the partials
of each side, G0 and G1, as we'll see here.

#+begin_src scheme
(define GD-properties
  (let ((GD0 (lambda (local)
               (* (coordinate local)
                  (sin (time local)))))
        (GD1 (lambda (local)
               (cos (time local)))))
    (G-properties GD0 GD1 (literal-function 'x))))
#+end_src

The partials for each side don't match.

#+begin_src scheme
(se GD-properties)
#+end_src

*** Part E

This is strange to me, because I thought that this thing had to produce a tuple.

OH, but the secret is that Qdot is also a tuple, so you contract them together.

Here's the function F that we can use to derive it:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (FE local)
  (let* ((t (time local))
         (q (coordinate local))
         (x (ref q 0))
         (y (ref q 1)))
    (* (+ (square x) (square y))
       (cos t))))
#+end_src

Boom, total time derivative!

#+begin_src scheme
(check-f FE (up (literal-function 'x)
                (literal-function 'y)))
#+end_src

And let's show that we pass the tests by decomposing this into G0 and G1:

#+begin_src scheme
(define GE-properties
  (let (
        ;; any piece of the function without a velocity multiplied.
        (GE0 (lambda (local)
               (let* ((t (time local))
                      (q (coordinate local))
                      (x (ref q 0))
                      (y (ref q 1)))
                 (* -1
                    (+ (square x) (square y))
                    (sin t)))))

        ;; The pieces multiplied by velocities, split into a down tuple of
        ;; components, one for each of the coordinate components.
        (GE1 (lambda (local)
               (let* ((t (time local))
                      (q (coordinate local))
                      (x (ref q 0))
                      (y (ref q 1)))
                 (down
                  (* 2 x (cos t))
                  (* 2 y (cos t)))))))
    (G-properties GE0 GE1 (up (literal-function 'x)
                              (literal-function 'y)))))
#+end_src

BOOM!

We've recovered F; the partials are equal, and the final matrix is symmetric.

#+begin_src scheme
(se GE-properties)
#+end_src

*** Part F

This one is interesting, since the second partial is a tuple. This is not so
obvious to me, so first let's check the properties:

#+begin_src scheme
(define GF-properties
  (let (
        ;; any piece of the function without a velocity multiplied.
        (GF0 (lambda (local)
               (let* ((t (time local))
                      (q (coordinate local))
                      (x (ref q 0))
                      (y (ref q 1)))
                 (* -1
                    (+ (square x) (square y))
                    (sin t)))))

        ;; The pieces multiplied by velocities, split into a down tuple of
        ;; components, one for each of the coordinate components.
        (GF1 (lambda (local)
               (let* ((t (time local))
                      (q (coordinate local))
                      (x (ref q 0))
                      (y (ref q 1)))
                 (down
                  (+ (cube y) (* 2 x (cos t)))
                  (+ x (* 2 y (cos t))))))))
    (G-properties GF0 GF1 (up (literal-function 'x)
                              (literal-function 'y)))))
#+end_src

AND it looks like we DO have a total time derivative, maybe. We certainly pass
the first test here, since the second and third tuple entries are equal.

BUT we fail the second test; the hessian that we get from ((partial 1) G1) is
not symmetric.

We can change this a little to see the extra terms; substract off the free
particle lagrangian, to see the extra stuff.

Here's the gnarly version with both entries as actual functions. Can this be a
total time derivative? It CANNOT be, because we have a $(D \Delta_v(t))^2$ term
in there, and we know that total time derivatives have to be linear in the
velocities. The function $F$ would have had to have a velocity in it, which is
not allowed.

Let's simplify by making the $\Delta_v$ constant and see if there's anything so
obvious about $\Delta_x$.

We know that we have a total derivative when $\Delta_x$ is constant, and we know
that total time derivatives are linear, so let's substract off the total time
derivative and see what happens:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes

            (compose L (Gamma (q dx))))))

\[\begin{equation}
{\Delta}_{v} m D{\Delta}_{x}\left( t \right) + m D{x}^\prime\left( t \right) D{\Delta}_{x}\left( t \right)
\end{equation}\]

Take a look. there is a quadratic velocity term in here! We have $D \Delta_x(t)
D x'(t)$. This is not allowed in a total time derivative.

SO, only if the shift and uniform translation are constant do we not affect the
Lagrangian value.

You're supposed to do these by hand, so I'll do that in the textbook. But here,

Or with the $D$ symbol:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes

\end{equation}

Or, we could show that they're equivalent this way:

#+begin_src scheme :results value raw :exports both :cache yes
(let ((f (down ((partial 0) F) ((partial 1) F))))
  (->tex-equation
   (- ((D F) 'x 'y)

A further exercise is to try defining the functions so that they use explicit

to be really pro, I'd make a function that takes these as arguments and prints a
